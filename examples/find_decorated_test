# Problem: a test failure in the workarea-reviews plugin had eluded us for quite
# a while. During the hustle-n-bustle of the plugin updates at the end of the
# last minor release, the theme plugins just decorated the test. Now that the
# test has been fixed we need to obtain a list of plugins that have decorated
# this test so that we can go and manually edit them.
#
# Adds a file to `/tmp/decorated_tests.log` FYI.
#
# Command to run:
#
# wagemage \
#   --org workarea-commerce \
#   --repo '-theme$' \
#   --branch '(-stable$|^master$)' \
#   --script examples/find_decorated_test \
#   --debug
